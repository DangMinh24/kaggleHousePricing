Few experiment with data analysis
Try to explore data much more than using model like a black-box tool


First Attempt: Try to detemine that whethere this problem works well with Linear Regression Problem or Non-Linear Problem. Conclusion: Linear Regression work better than Non-Linear Regression

Second Attempt: Try to analysis data and feature engineering

Third Attempt: Try different models (different algorithm Lasso, Ridge, RF, XGBoost) and tunning
